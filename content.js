          body: "A savings account paying 0.5% APY loses purchasing power every year when inflation runs at 3–4%. Investing puts your money into assets — stocks, bonds, index funds — that historically grow faster than inflation over long periods. The S&P 500 has returned an average of roughly 10% per year before inflation over the past 50 years. That does not mean every year is positive — it means the long-run trend rewards patient, diversified investors. The key insight: $200 per month invested at 8% for 30 years grows to approximately $298,000. The same $200 sitting in a 0.5% savings account becomes about $79,000. Time and return rate are the two most powerful variables in your financial life, and both favor starting early.",

        {
          title: "Risk, time horizon, and diversification",
          body: "Every investment carries risk — the possibility that its value drops. But risk and time horizon are deeply connected. A 22-year-old investing for retirement at 65 has 43 years to recover from market downturns. A 55-year-old needs to retire in 10 years and cannot afford to wait out a decade-long recovery. This is why your time horizon should drive your asset allocation, not headlines or fear. Diversification reduces risk without necessarily reducing returns. When you own 500 companies through an S&P 500 index fund instead of just one stock, a single company's failure does not ruin your portfolio. Stocks, bonds, and cash all move differently in different economic conditions — mixing them is one of the few genuinely free lunches in investing.",

          title: "Accounts matter as much as investments",
          body: "Where you invest is often more important than what you invest in. A Roth IRA lets your money grow completely tax-free — you pay taxes now, but never again on the gains. If you invest $6,000 per year in a Roth IRA starting at 22 and it grows to $800,000 by retirement, you pay zero tax on that $800,000. A traditional 401(k) reduces your taxable income today and taxes you at withdrawal. Most experts suggest: max your 401(k) match first (that is a 50–100% instant return), then fund a Roth IRA, then invest in a standard brokerage account. For beginners, low-cost index ETFs like VTI (total US market), VXUS (international), or BND (bonds) cover almost everything you need at expense ratios below 0.10%.",
